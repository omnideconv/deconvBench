# deconvBench: a nextflow pipeline to benchmark second-generation deconvolution methods using omnideconv

For our effort to benchmark eight second-generation deconvolution methods, all included in [Omnideconv](https://github.com/omnideconv/omnideconv), we implemented a nextflow pipeline that includes several workflows. These offer various simulation scenarios and the option to deconvolve real bulk RNA-seq datasets, all with different scRNA-seq datasets, deconvolution methods and other parameters. 
A detailed description of the parameters and workflows follows below.

## Workflows

![Alt text](workflows.png)

### main
The **main** workflow is run by using nextflow without the `-entry` parameter.


This workflow does signature creation, deconvolution and result metric calculations on the selected deconvolution methods (`method_list`) and datasets (`single_cell_list`, `bulk_list`).

In the **main** workflow following processes are run:
1. CREATE_SIGNATURE - Creates signature matrix from scRNA-seq datasets set in `single_cell_list`.
2. DECONVOLUTION - Deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets set in `bulk_list` using the  created signature matrices.
3. COMPUTE_METRICS - Calculates the metrics for the deconvolution results.

The results of the **main** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_general` directory.

### subsampling
The **subsampling** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry subsampling` parameter.


This workflow builds upon the **main** workflow and adds a cell-type specific subsampling step. The size of the subsets and the number of replicates can be controlled by the parameters `ct_fractions` and `replicates`.

In the **subsampling** workflow following processes are run:
1. PREPROCESS_SINGLE_CELL - For each scRNA-seq dataset in `single_cell_list` the dataset is subsampled and preprocessed. If `ct_fractions` contains integer, the number of cells to be subsampled per celltype is equal to the integer, which corresponds to an *even* sampling. For floats, we do a *mirrordb* style sampling, where  a corresponding fraction of the total number of cells per celltype is sampled. The number of replicates is controlled by the `replicates` parameter. Cells are drawn randomly without replacement.
2. CREATE_SIGNATURE - Creates signature matrix from the subsampled scRNA-seq datasets.
3. DECONVOLUTION - Deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets set in `bulk_list` using the  created signature matrices.
4. COMPUTE_METRICS - Calculates the metrics for the deconvolution results.

The results of the **subsampling** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_general` directory.

### impact_missing_cell_types
The **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry impact_missing_cell_types` parameter.


This workflow excludes cell types from the scRNA-seq datasets (`single_cell_list`) and then deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets(`bulk_list`) using the created signature matrices. The cell types to be excluded are controlled by the `cell_types_to_exclude` parameter. The workflow is repeated for each cell type in the list, where each time one cell type is excluded.

In the **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow following processes is run:
1. ANALYSIS_BULK_MISSING_CELL_TYPES - Excludes `cell_types_to_exclude` cell types from the `single_cell_list` scRNA-seq datasets and deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets using the created signature matrices. Finally, the metrics for the deconvolution results are calculated.

The results of the **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_missing_cell_types` directory.

### simulation_unknown_content

The **simulation_unknown_content** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry simulation_unknown_content` parameter.


This workflow simulates the presence of an unknown cell type in  the bulk RNA-seq datasets (`bulk_list`). The unknown cell type is controlled by the `unknown_cell_type` parameter.

In the **simulation_unknown_content** workflow following processes are run:
1. SIMULATE_BULK_UNKNOWN_CELL_TYPE - Creates simulated bulk RNA-seq datasets with the presence of `unknown_cell_type` . The datasets are created using the `bulk_list` datasets. The fraction of the unknown cell type is controlled by the `fractions_unknown_cells` parameter. The number of replicates is controlled by the `replicates_unknown_content` parameter. 

2. ANALYSIS_BULK_UNKNOWN_CELL_TYPE - Creates signature matrices using `known_cell_types` subsetss of the `single_cell_list` datasets and deconvolves the simulated bulk RNA-seq datasets using the created signature matrices. Finally, the metrics for the deconvolution results are calculated.

The results of the **simulation_unknown_content** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_unknown_content` directory.

## Input Formats

## Data Normalizations

Each deconvolution method has a recommended set of normalization procedures, both for the scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq samples. Possible options currently are `counts` (un-normalized), `tpm` and `cpm`. The specific values for each method are stored in the `optimal_normalization.csv` file, and at time of publication look like this:

| method       | sc_norm   | bulk_norm |
|----|----|----|
|autogenes|cpm|tpm|
|bayesprism|counts|counts|
|bisque|counts|counts|
|cibersortx|cpm|tpm|
|dwls|counts|tpm|
|music|counts|tpm|
|scaden|counts|tpm|
|scdc|counts|tpm|
