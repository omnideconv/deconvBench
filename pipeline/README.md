# deconvBench: a nextflow pipeline to benchmark second-generation deconvolution methods using omnideconv

For our effort to benchmark eight second-generation deconvolution methods, all included in [omnideconv](https://github.com/omnideconv/omnideconv), we implemented a nextflow pipeline that includes several workflows. These offer various simulation scenarios and the option to deconvolve real bulk RNA-seq datasets, all with different scRNA-seq datasets, deconvolution methods and other parameters. 
A detailed description of the parameters and workflows follows below.

## Dependencies

All method-related dependencies are installed in a inlcuded Docker image, that you can either build yourself using the Dockerfile in the directory above (`docker/`) or pull it directly from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alexd13/omnideconv_benchmark/general). 
*Note:* We currently only provide a Docker image for Linux based systems, Mac and Windows are not supported. User working on those operating systems have to install omnideconv manually.

In addition, to run the pipeline you need an installation of [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). 

## Quickstart

If you want to deconvolve two bulk RNA-seq datasets (`bulk1` and `bulk2`) using one scRNA-seq dataset (`sc1`) and compute quality metrics for four selected deconvolution methods (`AutoGeneS`,`DWLS`,`MuSiC` and `Scaden`), you can start the pipeline like this, inside the current directory:

```
nextflow -C nextflow.config run main.nf -profile docker
```

The `nextflow.config` file can then look something like this:

```
params {
    data_dir_bulk = "/user/benchmarking/datasets/bulks"
    data_dir_sc = "/user/benchmarking/datasets/single_cell"
    results_dir_general = "/user/benchmarking/results"   

    single_cell_list = ["sc1"]
    bulk_list = ["bulk1","bulk2"]
    method_list = ["autogenes", "dwls", "music", "scaden"]

    ncores = '4'
}

profiles {
    docker {
        docker.enabled = true
        process.container = 'omnideconv_benchmark:1.0'
        // add more parameters regarding e.g. memory usage here
    }
}

```
Running the pipeline with the above configuration will expect the following folder structure:


```

## Workflows

This is a basic overview of the workflows that are offered in this pipeline. The parameters can be adapted in the `nextflow.config` file and are described below.

![Alt text](workflows.png)

### main
The **main** workflow is run by using nextflow without the `-entry` parameter.


This workflow does signature creation, deconvolution and result metric calculations on the selected deconvolution methods (`method_list`) and datasets (`single_cell_list`, `bulk_list`).

In the **main** workflow following processes are run:
1. CREATE_SIGNATURE - Creates signature matrix from scRNA-seq datasets set in `single_cell_list`.
2. DECONVOLUTION - Deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets set in `bulk_list` using the  created signature matrices.
3. COMPUTE_METRICS - Calculates the metrics for the deconvolution results.

The results of the **main** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_general` directory.

### subsampling
The **subsampling** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry subsampling` parameter.


This workflow builds upon the **main** workflow and adds a cell-type specific subsampling step. The size of the subsets and the number of replicates can be controlled by the parameters `ct_fractions` and `replicates`.

In the **subsampling** workflow following processes are run:
1. PREPROCESS_SINGLE_CELL - For each scRNA-seq dataset in `single_cell_list` the dataset is subsampled and preprocessed. If `ct_fractions` contains integer, the number of cells to be subsampled per celltype is equal to the integer, which corresponds to an *even* sampling. For floats, we do a *mirrordb* style sampling, where  a corresponding fraction of the total number of cells per celltype is sampled. The number of replicates is controlled by the `replicates` parameter. Cells are drawn randomly without replacement.
2. CREATE_SIGNATURE - Creates signature matrix from the subsampled scRNA-seq datasets.
3. DECONVOLUTION - Deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets set in `bulk_list` using the  created signature matrices.
4. COMPUTE_METRICS - Calculates the metrics for the deconvolution results.

The results of the **subsampling** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_general` directory.

### impact_missing_cell_types
The **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry impact_missing_cell_types` parameter.


This workflow excludes cell types from the scRNA-seq datasets (`single_cell_list`) and then deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets(`bulk_list`) using the created signature matrices. The cell types to be excluded are controlled by the `cell_types_to_exclude` parameter. The workflow is repeated for each cell type in the list, where each time one cell type is excluded.

In the **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow following processes is run:
1. ANALYSIS_BULK_MISSING_CELL_TYPES - Excludes `cell_types_to_exclude` cell types from the `single_cell_list` scRNA-seq datasets and deconvolves the bulk RNA-seq datasets using the created signature matrices. Finally, the metrics for the deconvolution results are calculated.

The results of the **impact_missing_cell_types** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_missing_cell_types` directory.

### simulation_unknown_content

The **simulation_unknown_content** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry simulation_unknown_content` parameter.


This workflow simulates the presence of an unknown cell type in  the bulk RNA-seq datasets (`bulk_list`). The unknown cell type is controlled by the `unknown_cell_type` parameter.

In the **simulation_unknown_content** workflow following processes are run:
1. SIMULATE_BULK_UNKNOWN_CELL_TYPE - Creates simulated bulk RNA-seq datasets with the presence of `unknown_cell_type` . The datasets are created using the `bulk_list` datasets. The fraction of the unknown cell type is controlled by the `fractions_unknown_cells` parameter. The number of replicates is controlled by the `replicates_unknown_content` parameter. 

2. ANALYSIS_BULK_UNKNOWN_CELL_TYPE - Creates signature matrices using `known_cell_types` subsetss of the `single_cell_list` datasets and deconvolves the simulated bulk RNA-seq datasets using the created signature matrices. Finally, the metrics for the deconvolution results are calculated.

The results of the **simulation_unknown_content** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_unknown_content` directory.


### simulation_impact_technology

The **simulation_impact_technology** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry simulation_impact_technology` parameter.

In this workflow we evaluate the impact of differences in tissue origin and sequencing technology on deconvolution results. 

In the **simulation_impact_technology** workflow following processes are run:
1. SIMULATE_PSEUDOBULK_MIRRORDB - For each dataset in `datasets_impact_technology` we first identify all common cell types across datasets. Then create as many pseudobulk replicates as the specified in `replicates_simulation`; simulations are created using the 'mirrordb' scenario in SimBu, which matches the cell type fractions from the single-cell dataset to the pseudobulk.

2. ANALYSIS_PSEUDOBULK_MIRRORDB - Using each dataset in `datasets_impact_technology`, the previously created pseudobulk will be deconvolved. This means that you can add datasets from different technological backgrounds and see how they differently perform during deconvolution of the same pseudobulks.

The results of the **simulation_impact_technology** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_impact_technology` directory.

### simulation_resolution_analysis

The **simulation_resolution_analysis** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry simulation_resolution_analysis` parameter.

This workflow assesses the impact of annoating the usage of single cell atlases with different levels of cell type annotations. 

In the **simulation_resolution_analysis** workflow following processes are run:

1. SIMULATE_BULK_RESOLUTION_ANALYSIS - Pseudobulks are created by using different levels of annotation granularity.

2. ANALYSIS_BULK_RESOLUTION_ANALYSIS - Using each level of annotation, the single-cell reference is used for deconvolution of the previoudly simulated samples


The results of the **simulation_resolution_analysis** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_resolution` directory.


### simulation_spillover


The **simulation_spillover** workflow is run by using nextflow with the `-entry simulation_spillover` parameter.

This workflow assesses the impact  the erroneous prediction of a cell type caused by the occurance of cell types with similar transcriptional profiles.

In the **simulation_spillover** workflow following processes are run:

1. SIMULATE_BULK_SPILLOVER - For each cell type in `spillover_celltypes` a set of pseudobulks is created, where only cells from this cell type are sampled from the single-cell dataset ('pure' scenario in SimBu).

2. ANALYSIS_SPILLOVER - The previously simulated samples are deconvolved using the full single-cell dataset

The results of the **simulation_spillover** workflow are stored in the `results_dir_spillover` directory.

## Input Formats
The pipeline expects the input data to be in a specific format. The following sections describe the expected format for the scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets.
### scRNA-seq datasets
- `batch.rds` - a character vector equal to the number of cells, indicating the batch of each cell.
- `celltype_annotation.rds` - a character vector equal to the number of cells, indicating the cell type of each cell.
- `matrix_counts.rds` - a matrix with the raw counts of each gene in each cell. Columns are cells, rows are genes. Is selected when  `single_cell_norm` config is set to "*counts*".  
- `matrix_norm_counts.rds` - a matrix with the normalized counts of each gene in each cell. Columns are cells, rows are genes. Is selected when  `single_cell_norm` config is set to "*cpm*".

### bulk RNA-seq datasets
- `bulk_counts.rds` - a matrix with the raw counts of each gene in each sample. Columns are samples, rows are genes. Is selected when  `bulk_norm` config is set to "*counts*". 'bulk' is a placeholder for the name of the bulk RNA-seq dataset, e.g. `finotello'.
- `bulk_tpm.rds` - a matrix with the TPM of each gene in each sample. Columns are samples, rows are genes. Is selected when  `bulk_norm` config is set to "*tpm*". 'bulk' is a placeholder for the name of the bulk RNA-seq dataset, e.g. `finotello'.
- `bulk_facs.rds` - a matrix of true fractions for each cell type. Columns are samples, rows are cell types.
 'bulk' is a placeholder for the name of the bulk RNA-seq dataset, e.g. `finotello`.



## Data Normalizations 

Each deconvolution method has a recommended set of normalization procedures, both for the scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq samples. Possible options currently are `counts` (un-normalized), `tpm` and `cpm`. The specific values for each method are stored in the `optimal_normalization.csv` file, and at time of publication look like this:

| method       | sc_norm   | bulk_norm |
|----|----|----|
|autogenes|cpm|tpm|
|bayesprism|counts|counts|
|bisque|counts|counts|
|cibersortx|cpm|tpm|
|dwls|counts|tpm|
|music|counts|tpm|
|scaden|counts|tpm|
|scdc|counts|tpm|


## Additional Information

Method-specific minor points:

### CIBERSORTx batch correction

CIBERSORTx offers two batch correction modes, S-mode and B-mode, which should be used in different settings. The usecase depends upon the input dataset characteristics, both from the bulk and single-cell dataset. 
If the bulk dataset has been simulated from the same single-cell dataset that will be used as reference, no batch correction should be used. If the bulk dataset originates from real samples, the batch correction depends on the technology of the single-cell dataset: In 10X-based dataset, S-mode should be used, in all other cases B-mode should be used.
In *deconvBench* we handle these options only in the main workflow, as all other worklfows only work with simulated data and we adapted them according to our specific datasets. The technology type of the single-cell dataset has to be added in the `pipeline/sc_datasets_technologies.csv` file, the correct naming convention for 10X-type datasets is simply `10X`, as given in the example.

**Disclamer:** During our benchmarking procedure, we were not able to use the B-mode from CIBERSORTx in its provided Docker container, as this ended with an error message that we could not influence. We therefore only used the S-mode in all these cases.
